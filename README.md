Technologies used: PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, AJAX, MySQL, jQuery, phpMyAdmin, Themeroller, Bootstrap, UML.

This is a responsive web-based application that supports gym members and allows them to control their health and 
fitness progress through synchronisation with ubiquitous wearable technology – FitBit watch.

While potential clients can navigate around the site for more information about the different programs as well as some
general keep-fit and lifestyle information they may be enquiring about. Extra features like image rotator are designed 
to give the page an aesthetically pleasing look and feel.

The themroller library helps in building a highly-responsive website by implementing tools such as: toolips, accordions, tabs, 
date-picker, sliders, drop-down buttons, navigation bar, and more. 

Throughout the website application the team have incorporated many features and functions that are considered best practise 
in modern web design. Some of these features like the style switcher or the zoomer are incorporated into the design for users
that have visual impairment also google maps are used in the contact page. 

One of the features incorporated into the project is a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator. This function uses javaScript to determine
the BMI by taking in the user’s height and weight. The application also includes error handling with the BMI calculations where if
the user input is invalid an appropriate response will be activated.

To cope with security issues, ‘prepared statements’ and ‘binding parameters’ are implemented to prevent MySQL injection threats. 
The framework OAuth 2.0 is used by Fitbit for user API authentication and authorization.
